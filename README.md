# DefensePointRagnarok
 
This game project is written in the Monogame engine.
It was developed as part of my second semester exam project studying computer science, and incorporates several technologies that were listed as requirements.
These technologies include: Databases, threading, pathfinding algorithms, and design patterns.

The game is a real-time tower defense, wherein the player moves using WASD controls, and towers can be purchased and placed with the space key.
